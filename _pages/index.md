Hello There, I see you have stumbled across my page. I am still assembling it, so ones wonder how you are here. Now that you are, if you are curious how assembly is going, check out my posts.

I am making this to be a place where I talk about random ideas from physics, getting my first paper to publish, my work on exoplanets, and chaotic things I do. Stick around if that sounds like something you could enjoy.
