Today is the Sunday before SURF officially starts, but I have been so excited about it that I decided to start my project today. I am working with the Exoplanet Technology lab at Caltech under the mentorship of Dimitri Mawet and Jean-Baptiste Ruffio. Officially, the project is "Developing planet detection and instrument calibration methods for moderate resolution spectroscopy with Keck/OSIRIS." Did I say that I am excited?

I plan to write a GitHub repository that can automatically analyze the data that high/moderate-resolution spectrographs (like OSIRIS or SINFONI) throw out, perform wavelength and resolution calibration on it better than the native instruments' pipeline does, and then tell the user whether we have directly-imaged an exoplanet in the image they took. 

We want to use this code on fresh OSIRIS data we collect in late June. I get to be a part of the observing team and operate the Keck telescope at Mauna Kea, so that's gonna be another cool bit. 

What gets to me, drives me, and makes me get through the toughest of times in science is the feeling that, at the end of it all, I get to know that I witnessed this unique bit of the universe around us, for the first time in history. That I am the first one who nature has revealed this tiniest part of itself. For my first summer, it was seeing calibration maps for the first receiver of the BICEP array. I remember the morning I went into lab and ran the code after my assembly had ran for over ten hours, and then seeing the fruit of all the work we had done. Then, next summer, it was being able to analyze electrothermal feedback in TKIDs. This summer, I hope I can find something around a star that I would be the first one to know about.
