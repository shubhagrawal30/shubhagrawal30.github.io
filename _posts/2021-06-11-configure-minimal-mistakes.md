My theme offers me a lot of design and set-up options. This post talks about how I decided between them, and it will hopefully help you do the same. 

I went through the sections on the [*Configuration*][mm-config] page one-by-one. 

* I am not using the Ruby gem version. Rather, to host on GitHub pages, I needed to use the `remote_theme` method, as in [an earlier post][post].

* I am using the 'mint' skin right now. The 'dirt' skin also looks pretty cool.
